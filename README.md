# Logomaker: Software for the visualization of sequence-function relationships

LogoMaker is a lightweight python package for generating publication-quality sequence 
logos. LogoMaker can generate logos from a variety of data including user-supplied motifs, 
sequence alignments, enrichment data from massively parallel reporter assays or deep mutational 
scanning experiments, and so on. A large number of optional parameters enable a high level of 
customization. This functionality can be accessed via a web interface, from the command line,
or from within Python. When using the Python API, logos are generated as native matplotlib
axes objects that are amenable to subsequent customization and incorporation into multi-panel figures.

**Installation** :
pip install logomaker
