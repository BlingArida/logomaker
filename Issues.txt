Update: 10/27/2017

Issues 1 through 4 have been fixed. Need to display warnings on non-default-parameter additions

Dated: 10/24/2017

The current list of issues that needs to be implemented is the following:

1) Make homepage parameters editable (or hide update button)
2) Should new uploaded data display any parameters? 
3) Display flask debug messages in feedback
4) Check upload conditionals
5) Create a box for upload background matrix
