The current list of issues that needs to be implemented is the following:

1) Make homepage parameters editable (or hide update button)
 	this is almost resolved, just need to fix parameter correctly
2) Should new uploaded data display any parameters? 
3) Display flask debug messages in feedback
4) Check upload conditionals
	this is working reasonably but I will continue to check
5) Create a box for upload background matrix
