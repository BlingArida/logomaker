Tutorial
========

This tutorial provides a walk through of Logomaker via a series of `Jupyter notebooks <https://jupyter.org/>`_.
Each notebook focuses on a different aspect of the Logomaker functionality. To run the notebooks, simply
download the notebooks to your local machine and run them in a local Jupyter server. These notebooks
assume that the user has `pip` installed Logomaker already; if not, please download the notebooks
to a directory where the Logomaker repository is cloned.

Simple Example and Basic Styling
--------------------------------

The 'Simple Example and Basic Styling' tutorial notebook shows the user how to load data into Logomaker and draw
a logo. This tutorial also introduces some basic styling techniques.

- `Simple Example and Basic Styling <https://github.com/jbkinney/logomaker/blob/master/logomaker/tutorials/1_simple_example_basic_styling.ipynb>`_

Logos from alignment
---------------------

Logomaker provides methods to convert multiple sequence alignments to valid dataframes that can subsequently
be drawn. This functionality is covered in the 'Logos from alignment' tutorial.

- `Logos from alignment <https://github.com/jbkinney/logomaker/blob/master/logomaker/tutorials/2_logos_from_alignment.ipynb>`_

Transform between logos of different types
------------------------------------------

Logomaker supports multiple different logo types and allows the user to transform
from one type of logo multiple others. The 'Transform between logos of different types' tutorial walks the user through
this functionality and gives mathematical descriptions of the built-in matrices Logomaker supports.

Saliency Logos
--------------

Saliency logos are used to represent important nucleotides as predicted by deep neural networks. The tutorial notebook
saliency logos shows the user how to use Logomaker to draw saliency logos. This notebook contains two examples,
(i) a saliency logo based on randomly chosen saliency values and (ii) a saliency logo adapted from a publised paper.

- `saliency logos <https://github.com/jbkinney/logomaker/blob/master/logomaker/tutorials/4_saliency_logos.ipynb>`_

Advanced Styling
----------------

The advanced styling tutorial notebook introduces some advanced styling functionality that Logomaker offers.

- `advanced styling <https://github.com/jbkinney/logomaker/blob/master/logomaker/tutorials/5_advanced_styling.ipynb>`_

Glyph
-----

The glyphs tutorial notebook shows how Logomaker renders individual characters, or glyphs, and how to customize them.

- `glyphs <https://github.com/jbkinney/logomaker/blob/master/logomaker/tutorials/6_glyphs.ipynb>`_
